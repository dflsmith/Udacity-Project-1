# Udacity Project 1 (UP-1)

UP-1 is a python project that displays 6 of my favorite movies. It also includes
previews of the movies if you click on the image of each movie.

## Installation

To run this program, double click the fresh_tomatoes.html file which will
execute the program.

That's it, that's all you need to do.
